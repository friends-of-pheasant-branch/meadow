          <h1>What you see is what you pay</h1>
          <p>
          When other hosted providers advertise a price for their services, they fail to include the cost of an Internet connection, data network, phone and other charges. With managedIP Hosted, it’s all-inclusive. The price you see is the price you get. Want proof? Visit our <online cost comparison calculator> and see for yourself.

          <h1>Hosted vs. Premise-based</h1>
          <p>
          There are fundamental differences between a hosted VoIP solution and one based on your premises. They include not only the features of each, but also the cost. Make sure you understand these differences so you can make an informed decision on the best solution for your business. <Compare the two options here>.

          <h1>Phones</h1>
          <p>
            Bundled Internet and voice service will save you money, but it won’t do you much good if you don’t have the infrastructure in place to implement it. With TDS managedIP, you’ll have access to high-quality phones made by industry leaders such as Broadsoft and Polycom. They’re affordably priced, too, and available with interest-free financing. <Learn more.>  (Link to Phones page.)
